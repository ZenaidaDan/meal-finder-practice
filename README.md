I recently developed a meal finder website designed to simplify meal planning by allowing users to search for recipes based on the exact ingredients they have on hand or by focusing on main ingredients. The project, hosted on my GitHub repository under the name meal-finder-practice, offers a user-friendly interface where users can input specific items from their pantry or fridge—such as chicken, potato, or eggs—and the site generates tailored recipe suggestions. 
Built with a focus on reducing food waste and inspiring creativity in the kitchen, the website leverages a dynamic search algorithm to match ingredients with an extensive recipe database, making it an invaluable tool for home cooks of all skill levels.
